# A-Maze-Ing

A-MAZE-ING, as the name itself suggests, is an amazing maze game. A-MAZEING is an amazing E-Toy (Electronic toy) to everyone, that gives a thrill and kind 
of joy in solving it. We know that many people are interested in solving mazes that 
are seen in magazines. This toy best suits them. This is a 3d maze game where the 
players are supposed to make balls reach the goal by moving the maze. The game is 
controlled by Arduino Uno. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based 
on easy-to-use hardware and software. The Arduino is programmed to navigate 
through a Maze. This maze is a platform that is tiltable in all directions and at any 
sort of angle.
To make this game more interesting we introduced four different modes. The 
difficulty level of the game increases as we move to higher modes. The different 
modes are such as: 
➢ Normal mode: In this mode, the movement of the maze will be in the direction of the joystick 
moved.

➢ Inverse mode: The movement of the maze will be in the direction opposite to that of the direction 
of the joystick. There is a 180-degree phase away from the expected

➢ Slomo mode: This mode is bit interesting. In this mode there will be a delay of 2 seconds in the 
movement of maze to that of joystick movement. This was made by introducing a 
delay function in the code.

➢ God mode: This is an exciting mode. For this mode we installed proximity sensors into the 
circuit. The motion of maze can be controlled by hand gestures. Two sensors were 
used, one helps in to and fro motion and other for sideways movement.
