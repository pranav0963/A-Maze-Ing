# INTRODUCTION
A-MAZE-ING, as the name itself suggests, is an amazing maze game. A-MAZEING is an amazing E-Toy (Electronic toy) to everyone, that gives a thrill and kind 
of joy in solving it. We know that many people are interested in solving mazes that 
are seen in magazines. This toy best suits them. This is a 3d maze game where the 
players are supposed to make balls reach the goal by moving the maze. The game is 
controlled by Arduino Uno. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based 
on easy-to-use hardware and software. The Arduino is programmed to navigate 
through a Maze. This maze is a platform that is tiltable in all directions and at any 
sort of angle.
To make this game more interesting we introduced four different modes. The 
difficulty level of the game increases as we move to higher modes. The different 
modes are such as: 
➢ Normal mode
➢ Inverse mode
➢ Slomo mode
➢ God mode
